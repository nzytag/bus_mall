Assignement is to build a webapp for Puget Sound users. This app will have to display:  
1. Header with the name of the app
2. We need to display 3 images
* The images can be display in a variable in order to loop around them and display them randomly in the front.
* Images need to be able to show and not repeat in the front
3. We need to be able to keep track of the clicks on each and keep counting
